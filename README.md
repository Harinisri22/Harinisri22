## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi! I’m a motivated **B.Com graduate from Chennai** exploring the exciting field of **Data Analytics** by practicing hands-on with real-world datasets.

I enjoy using **Python, SQL, and Excel** to clean data, uncover patterns, and present meaningful insights through clear and interactive visualizations.

I'm currently applying my growing skill set to **small but meaningful projects** that strengthen my foundation and showcase my learning journey.

🚀 *Actively looking for full-time roles in data and tech support!*
