### 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi! I'm Harinisri, a B.Com graduate from Chennai taking my first steps into the world of data.  
I'm passionate about analyzing real-world datasets and presenting insights in a simple, visual way.

I enjoy working with **Python, SQL, and Excel** to organize data, find patterns, and create basic dashboards.  
Currently, I'm building beginner-friendly projects to strengthen my skills and showcase my journey.

🚀 *Actively seeking full-time roles in data analytics and IT support.*
